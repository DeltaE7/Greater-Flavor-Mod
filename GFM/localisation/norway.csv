grytviken_title;Lay claim to the south atlantic islands and offer to buy South Georgia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
grytviken_desc;No one ever lived properly on the South Georgia islands before thousands of brave Norwegian fishers went down there to live the whaling life. They even built a cinema and their own church, but due to British imperialism, the island unfortunately never became ours, but now we have the power to change history but not without diplomatic consequences from the Brits! To counter this, we're gonna send a request to purchase South Georgia and the Falklands for 30000 pounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bomuldsfabrique;Norway's First Factory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabriquedesc;"Haldens Bomuldsspinderi & Væveri," established in 1813, is said to be the first modern factory in Norwegian history. It all started with the ambitious 21 year old Mads Truelsen Wiel, who went to Copenhagen in then Denmark-Norway as a student and got to hear about the abolition of the textile import tax. This made him impulsively buy a weavery and modernize it. He thus fulfilled his dream since age 16 to found a modern factory, using money inherited from his father's business. After Sweden formed a union over Norway in 1814, he got special permission from the Swedish king in 1815 to properly establish the factory in the city of Fredrikshald (now "Halden"). After Mads died in 1835, he created a big impact on Norwegian industry. His son, Truels Wiel, now runs the business after inheriting it. Let's hope he knows what he's doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bomuldsfabrique2;Norway's First Factory Faces Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabriquedesc2;Although "Haldens Bomuldsspinderi & Væveri" lasted until 1971, this would be one of its many periods of loss and stagnation. The new owners that took over the factory in 1845, Boesen and Leegaard, hired many new skilled workers and remodernized the factory. But this would, unfortunately, be their downfall, as they spent more money on the factory than they had, and they failed to pay it back through their income. Historically, the factory survived this period of decline--but will you continue to maintain it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique_option2;Bye textile mill that was definitely not a dye factory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfire;The Ålesund Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfiredesc;Only one person has died in the fire, but 80% of the city is now destroyed. The most likely cause of the fire was a factory worker who committed arson. The German emperor, Wilhelm II, has offered to help us by paying to rebuild the entire city--ideally having it complete in 3 years! This will, of course, promote Norwegian-German friendship, but will overall strengthen their influence over our nation. It would be immensely praiseworthy Either way, Ålesund will grow to become a beautiful city built on the premises of the very popular Jugend style of architecture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

thranename;Marcus Thrane Publishes a Socialist Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thranedesc;Marcus Thrane, inspired by the revolutionary sentiments of 1848, has launched the "Thranite movement," the biggest political movement Norway has ever seen. He has amassed a petition of 12833 signatures and formed a trade union boasting 30000 members. His petition demands: "universal voting, the extension of mandatory military service to those with property, equality before the law, better schools, low or no border taxes on necessary goods, such as grains, and special support for poor farmers in the form of arable land on reasonable terms." \n\nHow should we respond to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

gaelic_education_nor;The Gaelic Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gaelic_education_nor_desc;We now own a large chunk of the Gaelic world. We thus need to assess our language policy in the Gaelic territories under our domain. We can develop and promote a variant of Norwegian mutually intelligible to our own, but with slight Gaelic influences to appeal to the population. We could also establish a semi-autonomous entity in Scotland and Ireland based in Dublin and several language schools teaching slightly Norwegian-influenced versions of Scottish and Irish. Finally, as a third option, we could establish central governance from our capital and language schools teaching a slightly Gaelic-influenced version of Norwegian. Whichever we choose, Ireland will prove highly attractive to Norwegian settlers, especially due to its climate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RISE_OF_STAVANGER_TITLE;The Stavanger Population Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RISE_OF_STAVANGER_DESC;During the early and middle portions of the 19th century, Stavanger's population grew at an extraordinarily high rate. The reasons of this were a mix of rapid falling rates of infant mortality, the vast availablity of food because of the area having the biggest farmlands in Norway, and a sprawling fishing industry. The last 2 reasons would bring lots of immigrants to the city. Stavanger went from having 4800 inhabitants in 1835 to having a whopping 16100 inhabitants in 1855.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ASSIMILATE_FAROE_TITLE;Faroese Assimilation Proves Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSIMILATE_FAROE_DESC;Faroese didn't begin to split from Norwegian before around 1400, but the linguistic choice we made for Norway chooses a Norwegian variant and path that longs back to the time before Norway became a part of any other nation, that being around 1400. Even though Landsmål still takes on a rather modernized version of old Norwegian, both Faroese and Landsmaal would be just as mutually intelligeble as Faroese and Icelandic. After months of the Faroe islands being under Norwegian control, the inhabitants have finally begun to understand this fact and are beginning once again embrace their Norwegian identity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

conquer_ireland_nor_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! During the Viking Ages, Ireland was largely populated with Norwegians, and the 5 main cities of Ireland at the time were founded by Norwegians, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Dublin. We are now on the position to reconquer Ireland, and regain our historical lands. (An event will pop up after the war giving you all of Ireland since scripting several casus bellis at once is impossible);;;;;;;;;
SCA_CONQUERED_IRELAND_EVENT_TITLE;Ireland is Under Our control!;;;;;;;;;
SCA_CONQUERED_IRELAND_EVENT_DESC;We have beat the greatest empire the world has ever seen, and now the Irish people will enjoy new leadership. From the 9th century to 1266 and in a lesser way up until the black death, Norwegians had huge influence on Irish and Scottish trade. Because of this, western Norway has arguably the highest concentration of redheads in Europe outside of Udmurtia, Russia and the British Isles.;;;;;;;;;
