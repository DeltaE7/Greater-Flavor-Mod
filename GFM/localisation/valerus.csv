COPENHAGENCHOLERA;Doctors have been warning us for decades about the unsanitary conditions present in the city of Copenhagen. Garbage and excrement flows in the streets, families are cramped tight inside the city walls and drinking water is simply supplied via hollowed-out logs from surrounding lakes. Now, our worst fears have come to pass: A severe outbreak of cholera has occurred! Over 7000 infections have been reported, of which hundreds have already died. The death toll will surely rise into the thousands, as experience in other cities shows that roughly 65% of cholera victims do not survive the illness. Additional cases have been reported outside the city, causing fears of the disease spreading throughout the country..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOMBAYPLAGUEEPIDEMIC;In 1855, a new, deadly plague pandemic originated in Yunnan. Thankfully, it remained contained in that mountainous region for many decades, but in 1894 it finally reached Hong Kong. From there, it was only a matter of time until it reached India. Now, the first cases have been reported in the bustling city of Bombay. Due to the mortality rate of 80%, the disease has thoroughly terrified the populace, causing tens of thousands of people to flee the city for the countryside. Dr Acacio Gabriel Viega, the man who diagnosed the first plague victim in the city, has begun a vociferous campaign to clean up slums and exterminate rats, the carriers of the fleas which spread the plague bacterium. We can only hope that his measures will bear fruit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATFLOODPARIS;Last Winter, Paris and the surrounding area experienced higher than normal rainfall, saturating the ground and filling rivers. The Seine's water level rose and fell again in December, lulling the people into a false sense of security. Just a few days ago, Parisians were preoccupied with daily life and consequently ignored the warning signs, including reports of mudslides and flooding occurring upriver. Now, water has begun pushing upwards from overflowing sewers and subway tunnels, seeping into basements through fully saturated soil. Thousands of Parisians have evacuated their homes as water infiltrates buildings and streets throughout the city, shutting down much basic infrastructure. With the water a full 8.6m above its usual level, the costs of repairing the ensuing damage will surely be in the millions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BALTICSEAFLOOD;News of a devastating flood has reached us from the Baltic Sea Coast. In the past few days, a storm blew from the southwest across the Baltic that drove the sea towards Finland and Baltic States. The result was flooding there and extreme low water levels on the Danish-German coastlines. The storm increased in strength, and suddenly changed direction. Tremendous winds now blew from the northeast, driving the water masses back in a south-westerly direction. Because the water could only slowly flow back into the North Sea, huge waves caught coastal dwellers by surprise and caused floods over a metre high in coastal towns and villages. According to the latest reports, nearly 300 people have died, almost three thousand homes have been destroyed, hundreds of ships have sunk and an estimated ten thousand livestock have drowned. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATFLOODINUS;Major rivers in the central and eastern United States have flooded from runoff and several days of heavy rain. A couple days before the flood, a massive blizzard engulfed 20 states. Then, strong Canadian winds stalled a high-pressure system off Bermuda and delayed the normal easterly flow of two large successive low-pressure systems passing over the Midwest. For two days, 3 to 8 inches of rain have fallen in Ohio, Indiana, and southern Illinois. Major rivers in Indiana and Ohio have experienced heavy runoff exacerbated by rising temperatures melting the leftover snow. Downstream, where the Ohio River enters the Mississippi, the water level has broken record highs. Cities such as Indianapolis, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Youngstown, Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio have all experienced severe flooding, causing heavy damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATSHEFFIELDFLOOD;To satisfy the expanding city of Sheffield's growing need for clean water, the Sheffield Waterworks Company constructed the Dale Dyke Dam to hold a reservoir for the city's use. Last night, as the reservoir was being filled, the company's resident engineer, John Gunson, noticed a concerning crack in the dam's structure, but thought it wasn't dangerous. In the middle of the night, the dam collapsed, releasing 3 million cubic meters of water barrelling into the city. The centre of the town, situated on the hill to the south, has escaped damage, but the densely populated district of the Wicker, around the new railway viaduct, has been completely destroyed. In all, 238 people have died and some 700 animals have been drowned. 130 buildings have been wrecked and 500 partially damaged. 15 bridges have been swept away and six others badly damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLOODINMISKOLC;Today, large storms coming from the Transdanubian region arrived in Northern Hungary -- first in Eger, next in Óhuta, Diósgyor and Miskolc, and then in Tállya, Golop and Mád. The rainfall swelled the streams Szinva and Pece, and destroyed the largest part of downtown Miskolc. The water has swept away bridges, mills and houses, carrying a large amount of debris. The water level rose by half a meter per minute, making it impossible for many people to escape. The water reached a depth of 4-5 meters in some parts of the city, destroying 2000 buildings and killing almost 300 people. Miskolc has a long history of floods, with major flooding occurring in 1691, 1788, 1813, 1845 and 1853. This is, however, by far the worst flood in the history of not just Miskolc but all of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHURCHOFTHECOMPANYFIRE;The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception was about to start when an oil lamp ignited some of the veils that adorned the walls. The situation got worse when a blow of strong wind knocked a candle off the podium. The fire started by the burning candle roared through the church which resulted in the church's destruction. The mostly women attendees panicked and tried to escape but the side doors, which close inwards, had been closed in order to leave space to accommodate more people, leaving the main entrance as the primary escape route for most occupants in the church. The priests retreated into the sacristy and closed the door to the sacristy, where they started gathering together the valuables of the church to save them. No one escaped through the sacristy after the door was closed. The priests then left the scene, all unharmed, with what valuables they were able to save from the blaze. More than 2500 people died in the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1897ASSAMEARTHQUAKE;Many reports are coming in as an earthquake could be felt across all of north-east India. The earthquake caused huge destruction to infrastructure, buildings and as a result trade has slowed down in that region. In Shillong, the earthquake damaged every stone house and half the houses built of wood.  The shock leveled the ground and resulted in 13 deaths. The fissure was also reported in the area. In Sohra Cherrapunji, it resulted in a landslide, which led to 600 deaths. In Goalpara, it resulted in waves from the Brahmaputra River, on which bank the town is situated on, destroying the market. In Nalbari, there were reported sightings of earth-waves and water waves. Damage was caused to Umananda Island temple and railway lines, where five people died. In Nagaon, every brick house was damaged, while traditional houses made of wood, with grass roofs, were bent. There were many small fissures/volcanos and the road was impassable for vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1889KUMAMOTOEARTHQUAKE;A small earthquake has disturbed the locals’ sleep in the south-west province of Kumamoto. Twenty people died and hundreds of houses and parts of Kumamoto Castle were destroyed. The earthquake was the first major one after the establishment of the Seismological Society of Japan. Few houses were affected by fire since the quake occurred at midnight. Locals are working hard to repair the damage that was caused by the earthquake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1880ATTEMPTASSASSINTSAR;People were shocked by a loud explosion coming from the Winter Palace itself. This was not an accident though, as the explosion happened in the dining room and was clearly meant to assassinate the Tsar. Due to this, we suspect that the Narodnaya Volya group was behind this attempt. However, this attempt was not a complete failure as 11 Finish Guards were killed and another 30 were injured by the explosion. Current suspects include a carpenter who’s toolbox contained little specks of gunpowder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1850ATTEMPTASSASSINENG;The Queen was attacked by Army Officer Robert Pete Francis Jr. while visiting Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. The Army Officer hit the Queen on the head with the short feruled cane that he was carrying. The blow was heavy enough to crush her bonnet and draw a little blood. The Queen thankfully survived the assassination attempt and is doing well. As for Pete, he has been arrested on the spot and taken to Vine Street police station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1905ATTEMPTASSASSINSULTAN;Assassination attempt on the Sultan! The attempt happened when the carriage was in front of the mosque. The Sultan received injuries, but besides that survived the attempt. The assassin was later identified as Zareh who threw the bomb at the Sultan, however the bomb exploded too early, killing Zareh, 25 members of the Sultan’s entourage and wounded another 85 and a number of civilians in attendance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
