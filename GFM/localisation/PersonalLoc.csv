unite_with_venezuela_desc;Venezuela and Colombia once not only formed part of one federation created by our forefather Simon Bolivar, but also were part of the same Spanish Viceroyalty. When the federation collapsed, Venezuela broke away from Colombia. Now that we have enough military power to enforce reunification, and good enough relations with our former kinsmen, it's time to right the wrong of the old country's dissolution.;Le Venezuela et la Colombie faisaient autrefois non seulement partie d'une fédération créée par le libérateur Simon Bolivar, mais faisaient également partie de la même vice-royauté. Lorsque la fédération s'est effondrée, le Venezuela s'est séparé de la Colombie. Maintenant que nous avons assez de pouvoir et de bonnes relations avec eux, nous allons à nouveau nous unir à nos frères.;Venezuela und Kolumbien waren einst nicht nur Teil einer vom Befreier Simon Bolivar gegründeten Föderation, sondern auch Teil desselben Vizekönigreichs. Als die Föderation zusammenbrach, trennte sich Venezuela von Kolumbien. Jetzt, wo wir genug Macht und gute Beziehungen zu ihnen haben, werden wir uns jetzt wieder mit unseren Brüdern vereinen.;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES2;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence unlike Venezuela and Ecuador who decided to stay. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSTAYS;Informed of the Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South was planning on declaring independence, founding the state of Ecuador. However, seeing the current position of Venezuela after the coup against Paez, many in the departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are wary of secession, since the South isn't in a position to break away without heavy retaliation from the North. Juan José Flores has tried to muster enough soldiers from the national army to avoid capture by the government, but failed to win over enough support from them. Flores has thus fled the country, averting an unwelcome separatist rebellion in the South..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASTAYS;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of General José Antonio Páez, hero of the Independence War, who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata, active between 1826 and 1829. From the start of Colombia's independence, Valencia's municipal assembly has always been anti-Bolivarian and fiercely resistant to the federation. However, much of the Venezuelan population disapproves of Valencia's independence, notably the army--which soon turned against Paez and his followers. Supported by caudillo Rafael Urdaneta, the army would organize a coup against Paez and force him to flee the country, finally dousing the flames of rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS2;With Juan Elegio Alzuru having met his fate at the receiving end of a firing squad, his revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope this day to spell the end of separatism in Colombia, as power-hungry caudillos see the writing on the wall and are standing down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE2;After many years of instability, Gran Colombia has finally deposed the caudillos threatening to secede from the country in defiance of our rule. Simón Bolívar, our venerated liberator, can rest easy knowing his magnificent nation remains unified. However, now that the tide of separatist rebellion has finally died down, we must ask ourselves what lies ahead for our future. How shall our country be run--under what ideology and government system?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
