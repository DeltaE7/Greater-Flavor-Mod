unite_with_venezuela_desc;Venezuela and Colombia once not only formed part of one Federation created by the Liberator Simon Bolivar, but also were part of the same Viceroyalty. When the federation collapsed, Venezuela broke away from Colombia. Now that we have enough power and good relations with them, we shall now unite with our brothers once again.;Le Venezuela et la Colombie faisaient autrefois non seulement partie d'une fédération créée par le libérateur Simon Bolivar, mais faisaient également partie de la même vice-royauté. Lorsque la fédération s'est effondrée, le Venezuela s'est séparé de la Colombie. Maintenant que nous avons assez de pouvoir et de bonnes relations avec eux, nous allons à nouveau nous unir à nos frères.;Venezuela und Kolumbien waren einst nicht nur Teil einer vom Befreier Simon Bolivar gegründeten Föderation, sondern auch Teil desselben Vizekönigreichs. Als die Föderation zusammenbrach, trennte sich Venezuela von Kolumbien. Jetzt, wo wir genug Macht und gute Beziehungen zu ihnen haben, werden wir uns jetzt wieder mit unseren Brüdern vereinen.;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES2;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence unlike Venezuela and Ecuador who decided to stay. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSTAYS;Informed of the Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South was planning on declaring independence, founding the state of Ecuador. However, seeing the current position of Venezuela after the coup against Paez, many in The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now not fond in a attempt of separation, since the south isn't in a position to break away without the agression from the north. Juan Jose Flores fearing that they might try to capture him, he tries to gather his army, but failed as the Army no longer supported him. Without any support, Flores finally flees from the country, freeing the South from any attempt of Separation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASTAYS;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General José Antonio Páez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. The assembly's rhetoric has been anti-Bolivarian from the start. However, many of the population in Venezuela weren't happy by this movement, especially the army of Venezuela which soon started to rebel against Paez and it's followers, supported by Rafael Urdaneta, a coup was organized against him. Paez was forced to flee, and the Separatist movement is finally dismantled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS2;Executed by General Tomás Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope this is the last attempt of the separatist movements that has being happening in all Gran Colombia, totally avoiding the collapse once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE2;After many years of inestability, Gran Colombia has finally removed those Caudillos who has been threatening with seceding the union for many years. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive for good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
