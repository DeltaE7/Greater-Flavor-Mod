1925DALIEARTHQUAKE;Today at 2:42 PM, a violent earthquake struck Dali, a city in western Yunnan, the location of its epicenter. The earthquake itself was caused by movement on the northwestern part of the Red River Fault, leaving 76,000 homes destroyed due to the shaking and its resulting fires. The tremors were so severe that it even caused the city walls of Dali to entirely collapse. About 3,600 inhabitants of the city have been tragically killed in the aftermath. We stand united in solidarity as we mourn the many lives lost and support the countless others who now find themselves displaced, injured, or bereft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1932IERISSOSEARTHQUAKE;This evening, a devastating earthquake occurred in the environs of Ierissos, a town at the base of the Athos Peninsula. Measuring at a surface magnitude of 7.0, the earthquake destroyed Ierissos in its entirety as well as several surrounding towns, leaving hundreds of people dead and nearly 10,000 homeless. A small tsumani was observed by tidal gauge, but never exceeded a meter in height and thankfully contributed no further damages. Aftershocks would continue into the following year, some exceeding a surface magnitude of 6.0. Between Ierissos and the villages nearby, over four thousand homes would be destroyed in addition to public and commercial buildings. Further to the east, even the sovereign monasteries of holy Mount Athos was not spared harm from the quake, with particular damage befalling those of Stavronikita and Koutloumousiou. In all, it is estimated that material damages incurred from the earthquake amount to roughly five million drachmas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1931NICARAGUAEARTHQUAKE;Disaster has befallen Managua! A bit past ten this Holy Tuesday morning, a horrendously powerful earthquake began in the western parts of Managua, lasting for roughly five seconds and reaching a magnitude of 6.1. The quake's epicenter was located in the cultural and financial center of the city, destroying all government buildings barring the Central Bank as well as nearly all of Managua's archives: Damages were recorded in buildings up to five kilometers away. Yet the earthquake itself was only the beginning of the tragedy - fires from stoves in a destroyed apothecary shop soon spread out of control, laying waste to the largely wooden buildings of the city. The city's unnatural level of crowding due to festivities and preparations for Holy Week only further exacerbated the chaos. The fires for a time burned out of control, with the earthquake earlier preventing the formation of fire brigades: Marines used dynamite in an attempt to demolish structures ahead of the fire, but only contributed to making the flames worse. In the next hour, over a thousand people would perish (with the local penitentary being particuarly stricken), and over 45,000 would be rendered homeless as nearly all of western Managua was destroyed. Tens of millions of dollars in property damages have occurred, and while an outpouring of foreign aid has begun, many see the cataclysm as signs of Managua itself being cursed. A few people have spuriously suggested relocating the Nicaraguan capitol to nearby Granada, which was unaffected by the earthquake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1930SENIGALLIAEARTHQUAKE;Italy just cannot get a reprieve from earthquakes. Just a few months after the quake in Irpinia, a 6.6 magnitude tremor rocked Senigallia, a central Italian city. Thankfully, the foreshocks preceding the main quake gave residents time to flood into the streets, avoiding death from collapsing buildings. This allowed the casualty rate to not exceed 18 lives--14 in Senigallia and 4 in Ancona. However, many families became homeless in the aftermath. Districts of Ancona such as Capodimonte and San Lazzaro were emptied of residents, their people taking refuge in outskirt encampments and by railroads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1930SALMASEARTHQUAKE;A 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the borderland between southeastern Turkey and northwestern Persia this morning. With an epicenter in the Salmas Plains, the main quake was preceded by a 5.4 magnitude foreshock 15 hours earlier, which significantly damaged local adobe homes. The foreshock would not deter residents from sleeping the night indoors, leading to high casualties when the mainshock struck. 60 villages were completely destroyed. The largest of them, Dilman, suffered such great damage that its inhabitants fled and re-established their homes in a nearby location, naming the new village Salmas. Overall, an estimated 1,360-3,000 people were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1930GARFAGNANAEARTHQUAKE;Earlier this morning, a massive earthquake struck the areas of Garfagnana and Lunigiana in northwestern Tuscany, causing massive damage to life and property. Preceded by a number of foreshocks the prior evening, a main shock of magnitude 6.8 occurred just before 8:00 AM local time with an epicenter directly beneath the town of Villa Collemandina. Between the main quake and aftershocks, Villa Collemandina along with the nearby towns of Vigneta and Fivizzano were completely destroyed: severe damage befell another thirty towns across Garfagnana and Lunigiana, with hundreds of others in a radius surrounding the epicenter reporting collapsed buildings or more minor damages. The earthquake was noticeable from up to 400 kilometers away, and could be felt in parts of Friuli and the the French Riviera. In all, the earthquake would claim 171 lives and cause 650 other casualties, leaving many thousands more homeless: Women and children ranked disproportionately among the dead and wounded on part of the highly agrarian nature of the area, with most farming men out to work in the fields when the main shock arrived. Damage to structures was amplified by the use of poor building materials such as smooth river stones in construction across much of the affected region. Relief has proceeded apace with help from local rescue operations, the military, and emigrant organizations in America and Argentina. Nevertheless, reconstruction is expected to take many years, and property speculation is beginning to run amok in particularly ruined places such as Fivizzano.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1920XALAPAEARTHQUAKE;It's official: the deadliest earthquake in Mexico's history has struck today in Xalapa, Veracruz. The quake, at a 6.3 magnitude, ravaged rural towns across Veracruz and Puebla. Its destruction became exacerbated by resulting landslides and mudflows, which destroyed all buildings in their path. The quake is now being sensationlized by the media, who expand the death toll to several thousand. Some even report sightings of an volcano eruption outside Xalapa. A desperate people have become too frantic to trust common news sources--thus obligating the Geological Institue of Mexico to uncover the truth. From what is being reported by them, it can be concluded that at least 648 deaths resulted from the quake.It's official: the deadliest earthquake in Mexico's history has struck today in Xalapa, Veracruz.

1929GRANDBANKSEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake has taken place off the shores of Newfoundland. Due to destruction wrought by the ensuing tsunami, contact with the devastated areas was not possible for the first few days after the disaster. Support only arrived 3 days later by way of ship, as the roads were still destroyed. While only 27 people have died, the magnitude 7 earthquake has caused severe damage, especially to the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland. Additionally, multiple submarine telegraph cables from Europe to the United States have been cut by the submarine landslide that caused the tsunami. The shaking was felt as far away as New York and Montreal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1917GUATEMALAEARTHQUAKE;A series of three major earthquakes has impacted Guatemala City. At every new shock a handful of houses went down. In most of the houses, walls have cracked in two and then roofs have fallen in. In churches, bell towers have crashed down, burying adjacent buildings and their occupants. The tremors were so severe that officials have had to burn about eight thousand dead to prevent pestilence from threatening the city, as they were shaken from their graves in Guatemala City General Cemetery. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless. An estimated 2650 people have perished. It will take years to undo the damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The President of Venezuela, awoken from his sleep by the shaking, fell from a balcony and broke his ankle as the earthquake struck at 4:30 AM. While the earthquake is the strongest to be recorded in Venezuelan records, it has caused less destruction than the one that happened a century ago. The tsunami caused by the earthquake, the epicenter of which was located underwater, also brought havoc to the coast. More than 250 aftershocks are projected to disrupt the people's lives for the next couple of months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
