The plague killed thousands, and many fled the city, leading to a drastic fall in the population of the city. In September 1896, Bombay's municipal administration declared the presence of bubonic plague in the city. The administration of ineffective protocols furthered the spread. By January 1897, half the population fled to the countryside."
