In the midst of the liberal revolutions, the rise of nationalism and nation-states, and an era where the Ancien Regime was thought to have died with the advent of modern liberalism, it is the forces of traditionalism, of dynastic politics stretching back centuries, that have found themselves in this prime position. Now, the Bourbon King of France and the Carlist king of Spain are one and the same, uniting the two realms of Europe into a single state. This coronation vindicates the eternal beliefs of the traditionalist nobility and upper society, but raises the ire of not only the upstart liberals and nationalists, but falls in brazen violation of the treaty of Utrecht, which forbade the union of the lines of France and Spain. This action poses an existential threat to the balance of power in Europe, and undoubtedly there will be a vitriolic response from the international community. It is doubtless that the coming years will be ones of unmatched turbulence since the days of Napoleon."
