This controversy has recently been reignited with the case of a known liberal agitator, an atheist, who has stolen several items from the local diocese, defaced them, then later returned them in a form of protest against the government. According to the law, he is meant to be executed, although this will undoubtedly anger the liberal population. To refuse to enforce the law in this case will in turn undermine its legitimacy.

The nobleman demanded that the land be returned to him, as well as the profits of the unlawful sale, citing his rightful ownership of the land as reason to declare both the land and the profits garnered from it as his, whilst the merchants refused to hand it over, citing free exchange as their right. The courts, staffed with royalist sympathizers, quickly ruled in favor of the nobleman, handing the land back to him. This event has become a fiasco, not just as other noblemen similarly deprived of land and status have begun making demands of a similar caliber, but as liberals have begun agitating once again over such concerns."

However, these reforms have come at a great cost to the political stability of the French realm, as many of the officers are no longer loyal to the king, or, in even more problematic fashion, have their loyalties placed with Republican ideals or even the Bonapartes. This has caused for the French realm a situation wherein the keys to maintaining government power are largely placed in the hands of those that do not want to see the current government in power to begin with. The current king has thus placed before the upper house an ingenious plan; By dissolving the levy altogether, all but totally abolishing conscription in the realm, the army can be drastically shrunken down to a small, professional core. This will create the onus and the excuse necessary to purge the military hierarchy of liberals and Bonapartists, leaving only a loyalist upper staff and officer corps that can be trusted to protect the Bourbon monarchy's interests."

With the monarchy finally secure in its seat, it is time to put an end to this crisis with a definitive solution. While restoring the full rights of serfdom is not posssible, it has been proposed that a revised form of peonage be the solution, with the peasants working off the cost of the land, with fixed final monetary payments, in order to compensate the nobility for the land they make residence in, and in return the produce will be subsidized by the government. Alternatively, distributism as our related Carlists in Spain have suggested can be implemented, granting both the nobility their titles and the peasantry their own land grants to even out the payment.

This will undoubtedly drive a permanent wedge between the French and the Polish, but ultimately it is a sacrifice that must be made in order to cool down the tense relations France unfortunately has had to endure.

While some more nationalistically inclined may have proposed that the american colonies are of a far greater importance due to their culturally French populations, their economic and strategic value are of little importance compared to the great prize of the east; the British Raj. In recent days, a highly ambitious French minister has opened up a trade deal with a local Indian official in Bombay, violating British monopolies in the region. Predictably, and as planned, Britain has forcibly shut down the deal, costing our government a sizable investment and brazenly insulting us. Should we so choose, this is an opportunity to not only regain French influence in India that has not been seen for nearly a century, but also to force the British out of the subcontinent and supplant them as the foremost European power in Asia."
