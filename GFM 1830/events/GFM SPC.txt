In following years he proved to be a loyal commander, albeit one that remained at great odds with the conduct of Carlist forces, leading to a number of defeats due to infighting and court intrigue. A decree was issued to Don Carlos, proclaiming him a traitor and responsible for the deaths of several high ranking officials in early conflicts with the Liberals. Only a short time later, with the complete noncompliance of the Carlist armed forces surrounding Maroto, and a confrontation between his supporters and Don Carlos, was this decree ultimately reneged. Maroto was later credited as saying 'I have triumphed over the arbitrariness, injustice, and blindness of a prince, and history will judge me in due course.' This has proven to be a substantial humiliation to the Royalist cause in Spain, and a key event in the formation of the Marotist party within its ranks."

To accomplish this, each Fuero will be reorganized into separate crownlands, held as a personal demesne of the king, but being fully integrated under the crown of Spain. This places the Basque, Catalan, and Galician regions under direct rule from the king, and governed by Carlist supporters, irrespective of where the legislative apparatus in Madrid leans politically. In turn, trade restrictions and customs borders will be devolved between the crownlands and the rest of the country, whereas the rights of Catalan and Basque to organize in their own separate military units and govern their own territory will remain intact indefinitely. In effect,  This new reform package sees a potential solution to the Fueros debate altogether, but will undoubtedly further anger the liberals of the country-perhaps to the point of open revolution, and even among some Carlists is held as an overly ambitious reform scheme, and one that perhaps even lends a great deal of undue power to the monarch.

As such, he seeks to not only preserve, but expand the privelegia of the fueros into full-scale autonomy and confederalism, devolving Spanish control into a mere rubber stamp for their own, largely independent actions.
