One of these powers, and for a time perhaps the greatest, was the Shilluk. While beaten down and presumed permanently broken in recent years, the Shilluk have daringly crossed downstream and seized Khartoum in the midst of our conflict with the Ottoman Turks. We can seldom afford a war with the diminished Shilluk at this delicate time, but we may be find them much stronger should we attempt to crush them later, or we may well find ourselves incapable of pushing the issue altogether. How must we respond?"
