EVTNAME00052;Death of Henri V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00052;Henri V, king of France, graced by God, has now passed. With him, the legitimate successors to the Bourbon line of Louis XIV has fully died out, and a new king must be selected. Some Legitimistes remain advocates of the absolutist line of the Bourbons, and have thus moved up the line to the Spanish Bourbons, otherwise known as the Carlist claimants to Spain. This is wildly unpopular, even among many monarchists, as this line is blatantly Spanish, and thus foreign to the French people, but selecting it opens the possibility of a power far outstripping that of most European powers, by uniting the Spanish and French thrones into one. Conversely, many Legitimistes have merged with the old Orleaniste movement, backing Philippe II, and thus adopting a more moderate, constitutionalist position. The choice remains ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00052;The throne shall pass to Jean III, the Spaniard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00052;The throne passes to Philippe II, and the constitution restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00053;Death of Jean III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00053;Jean III, King of France, rightful king of Spain, has died on this day, after only a short 5 year reign. With him, the line now passes to the next among the Spanish Carlists, a more conservative choice than the prior king. He shall be coronated as Charles XI of France. A military man, it is yet to be seen whether he will enforce the claim inherited by Jean III to the Spanish throne, or whether that eventuality remains little more than a pipe dream to the Bourbon throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00053;And so the crown passes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00054;Death of Charles XI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00054;On this day, Charles XI, king of France and the rightful heir to the Spanish throne, has died. He shall be followed by Jaime I. His procession is one of controversy, seen to some as a return to proper conservatism and a reaffirming of the noble privileges, and to others as a categorical failure, and a return to the reactionary politics so indicative of the Carlist and Legitimiste causes. Nonetheless, he shall be followed by Jaime, who inherits both the duchy of Madrid and the kingdom of Spain, to be titled Jaime III.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00054;Long live Jaime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00055;Death of Jaime I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00055;Jaime I has died, and shall be succeeded by Charles XII. His procession is one of little controversy or event, being one of a moderate, quiet-spoken monarch who will be remembered for little, praised for little, and hated for little. He shall be followed by Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, coronated as Alfonso I. A continuation of the Spanish line of Bourbons, it is feared that in the coming era this will hallmark a period of great instability for the French crown, though it remains to be seen whether these fears will come to pass or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00055;With a Heart of Iron France shall endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
