The Papal response therefore was to seek the advent of a 'third way' ideology, one that would come to be known as distributism. Characterized by clerical authority, land reform, agrarianism, and extensive preference to small business enterprise over corporations, the ideology would quickly gain traction as the primary economic policy of the Carlist movement. Passing this reform will therefore greatly strengthen resource output and education at the expense of heavy industrial efficieny, and the redistribution of land will undoubtedly come at great cost to the state."

With a more liberally-minded monarch in charge, perhaps a middle ground can be met, with the creation of a proper national legislature. The result is the Turnismo system, wherein the legislature is organized under a bicameral system between traditionalists and liberals, members of which are carefully selected before elections begin, and are purposefully rotated in order to ensure neither party maintains absolute control over the Spanish government."
